### Project 04 CAPSTONE AWS
This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a highly available, scalable, and secure web application architecture on AWS using core infrastructure services such as VPC, EC2, EFS, Auto Scaling, ALB, and Route53. The goal is to build a production-grade environment that can automatically scale during demand spikes, ensure uptime across multiple Availability Zones, and maintain consistent shared storage across multiple servers.
