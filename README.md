### Project 01 : Using virtual box and created Two vm run a webserver there also used port Forwarding. Tried simulating Dev and Test server all the implementation was done manually

### Project 02 : Used on VM in that used docker ran two docker container and used port forwarding so we can access containers web application which is running in docker which is in a vm and access it from host machine

### Project 03 : Used docker image of jenkins and created a pipeline job which download code from github and deploy on the same server where jenkins is running also created a docker-compose file to use docker compose, In this we have used volumes to make data persistent and also atached docker.sock file so we dont have to like download the docker in the container itself
